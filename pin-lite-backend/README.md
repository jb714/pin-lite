Thanks for visiting the 'Pequeño'/Pin-Lite repo, a small (pequeño) mirror of Pinterest.

To get started, please stay at this level of the directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

You can then run `npm start` or `nodemon start` to begin serving up the dataset and endpoints.

From there, feel free to head over to the client repo where the ReadMe provides instructions for getting started.
